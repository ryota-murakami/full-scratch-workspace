The repo is personal use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) based React Sandbox for experiment React's new feature, way of implementation something etc...  
So I have no intention to publishing as a polite OSS Project about the repo.  

Also the repo was bootstraped [Create React App TypeScript Templete](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-a-typescript-app)!! ðŸ¤—
